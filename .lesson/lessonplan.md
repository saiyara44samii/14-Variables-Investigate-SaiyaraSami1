# Variable Assignment 

This topic introcudes students to the concept of variables as placeholders for information in the code.  They learn how to create, name, assign data to and refer to the contents of variables.

## Learning Objectives/Goals

Be able to read, comprehend, trace, adapt and create Python code using selection that:

- Assigns data to variables
- Refers to variables in other statements such as ‘print’

## TEACHER NOTES

#### Prior Learning

- Algorithms - sequences of instructions for a task.

- Output - the information presented to the user by the computer.  In our programs output will be in the form of text on screen.

- Strings - data in text format

- Syntax - the format that code is written in.  If code is not written in the correct format it creates a **syntax error **and the program will not run.

#### New Learning

- Variable - a placeholder for information that can change as the program runs.

- Variable assignment - Using the '=' symbol to store data in a variable.

- Concatenation - joining the contents of variables to other variables and/or strings in output.

There are lots of similar tasks available online that you can use to supplement the ones in these resources.  I can particularly recommend:

The input/process/output diagram on the lesson slides will be referred back to in future sessions.

It’s important to ensure that students understand the difference between algorithm and program.

Once you have explained this we move on to coding output using the **print **statement.  This is one of the simplest commands in Python.  It offers instant feedback (users can see if it works or not straight away).  When students have had a chance to predict & test, start to explore how to break the statement.  This will give you a chance to highlight the importance of precision and correct syntax in programming.  I find it really helps if students appreciate this very early on.

Students learn how to use variables to store data and refer back to it.  Variables are used in a very similar way to letters in algebra - they represent the text.  Students can call variables anything they like, but there are some good practice principles:

## CODE EXAMPLES

Assign data to a variable
```
variableName = "string data"
variableName2 = number data
```

Concatenate a variable into an output (the *str()* is needed to convert the number in the variable into a string so that it will work with the concatenation).
```
"Your name is " + nameVariable
"You picked number " + str(numberVariable)
```

## PRIMM Task - Investigate
The ‘investigate’ stage gives students some example code and asks them questions about it to check their understanding.  I use the [block model](https://helloworld.raspberrypi.org/articles/hw14-the-i-in-primm)  to plan my questions.  Try it, it's really useful.



## Errors & Misconceptions To Watch Out For

- variable names are **exactly** the same (including caps), every time
- There is a variable on the **left** of each assignment
- They have used a single **=** for assignment
- They have used the **+** symbol to concatenate (join).
- The string text is surrounded by speech marks.
- The + and variable identifiers are **not** surrounded by speech marks
